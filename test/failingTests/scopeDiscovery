collecting types should be divided to 2 phases - first is discovery symbols and second is validating types etc.

class ComplexNumber {

    init (real: Double, imaginary: Double) {
        self.real = real;
        self.imaginary = imaginary;
    }

    var real: Double = 0;
    var imaginary: Double = 0;
}
